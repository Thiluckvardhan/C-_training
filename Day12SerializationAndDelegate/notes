XML Schema file is created with  .xs extension

publisher and Subcriber

What is an .xs file?
The .xs file is essentially an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file. It defines the rules for the structure and content of an XML document,
 specifying elements, attributes, data types, and relationships [1]. 

 Why is it used for publisher and subscriber?
In a publisher-subscriber (pub/sub) architecture, one component (the publisher) sends messages, and other components (the subscribers) receive those messages .The .xs file is crucial for this model because it ensures interoperability and data integrity: 


DeSerialization ?
Converting any serialized data to object type.


Object to XML Serialization in C#

XML Serialization converts a C# object into XML format
XML is used for data storage and data transfer
C# uses XmlSerializer for XML serialization

Why Do We Use XML Serialization?
To save object data in a readable format
To send data between applications
To store configuration or backup data

Where Is XML Used?
Web services (SOAP)
Configuration files
Data sharing between systems

Class and properties must be public - XmlSerializer works outside your class, It uses reflection to read data

Class must have a parameterless constructor - During deserialization, XML is converted back into an object, XmlSerializer first creates an empty object

Steps:
Create a class
Create an object
Use XmlSerializer
Call Serialize()
Store XML in a string or file

We use StringWriter because XmlSerializer requires a TextWriter, and StringBuilder is not a writer.

Simple analogy
XmlSerializer → needs a pen
StringWriter → acts like a pen
StringBuilder → is just the paper

Propertioes are converted to XMl
Functions are not considered in Serialization

The xml serialization will not work for Dictionary,Interfaces,Multidimensional Arrays,private fields /properties,read only properties,
 Objects without a public parameterless constructor, Methods and Indexers
